;   * higer value make purged filament like spagetti, and took a lots more space

;  Purge filament by pulse : the main change from original code is that here :
; - we are using constante time pause between pulse rather than a proportional time based on purge volume. Constant pulse pauses use a lot less time.
; - we use purge filament flow rate higher, it is safe as we are making little pause that let the plastic get molted more before extruding each pulse
